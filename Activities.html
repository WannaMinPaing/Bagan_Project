                       <h2>Sunrise/Sunset</h2>
                      <p>If you want to catch the best sunsets in Bagan then you need to head to Shwesandaw Paya which features a gorgeous pagoda built in the pyramid style out of white stone. There are steps cut into the temple which then lead up to five terraces which end at the top of a large stupa and from here you can experience panoramic views all over Bagan. Bear in mind that it gets crowded at sunset as it is known for its vistas, although the upper tier is quite spacious. If you want to check it out without the crowds however then just visit. </p>
